# SCout-AthenaHacks2022
INSPIRATION:
Inspired by our unfamiliarity with our new city, as well as frustrations with resources available to help us learn said new city, we’ve decided to become the change and create a site that for college students based off an actual college student’s budget, complete with beautiful sights, delicious food and more to grow through exploration of ourselves and our new home, LA. 

WHAT IT DOES:
With SCout, you can look at pre-planned day trips, restaurants/bars, upcoming events and activities for weekday/weekend leisure. 
 

THE BUILDING PROCESS:

Our website was created using HTML-CSS-Javascript. Utilizing Domain.com we linked our code to our domain name, scoutting.tech. Our website was then deployed through our GitHub Repository.

On our Home Page, you will see our Title and Logo,  University Drop-Down Menu, Navigation Bar, Image Slideshow, and information about the creators of this project. Our default university is USC, our host school. Selecting different universities will ideally change the location settings and suggestions for each suggestion page on the site. Our Navigation Bar is equipped to be utilized on every page. On the bottom of each page is a button that allows the user to return to the top of the page.

Selecting the ‘Events’ tab in the Navigation Bar will direct you to our Events Page where we utilized data from Googles Cloud API to generate a list of local events. Each event option is linked to it’s corresponding event host site.

Moving to the ‘Day Trips’ tab will direct you to the Day Trips Page. Here you will find blog posts about suggested day trip opportunities in your area. Each day trip features a modal with information about the suggested trip, including location, hours of operation, and recommended activities.

Our Activities tab will direct you to the Activities Page where a multitude of different opportunities to explore and get to know your city within in a college-student’s budget are recommended. There are tags and icons for extra information and accessibility.

Our last tab, “Restaurants & Bars” leads you to our final page where restaurants and bars in the surrounding area are listed. Each card lists information about the location, hours,and  price with a direct link to the restaurant’s menu.
 

CHALLENGES:

We were met with many challenges throughout the duration of this project. Since most of us weren’t very familiar with HTML/CSS, we were learning the language as we went and often encountered problems we didn’t immediately know how to solve. Most of the issues we experienced were related to the format of our website, in that we were able to add what we needed, but not where we wanted it. We spent a majority of our time looking up ways to move, align, and format the elements of the website into what we visualized in the beginning. Though we were met with many roadblocks, we persevered, tackling every challenge we were handed, and successfully crafting a beautiful site.


ACCOMPLISHMENTS WE’RE PROUD OF:

We’re proud of the way our format turned out. Despite the setbacks and challenges, our site looks sleek and elegant. We’re proud of the content of our site too, from the pretty transitions and information displayed on Daytrips to the look and tags of Activities to the playfulness mixed with informative essence present in Restaurants/Bars.


WHAT WE LEARNED:

We’ve learned how to handle challeges with formating, new programmning languages, patience, copy writing, and basic marketing research skills. 

As most of us weren’t familiar with HTML/CSS, we learned how to utilize many aspects of website development, from utilization of photo cards to modals to formatting and the language itself. Since many of our tasks were often related to each other, the repetition of making/changing each element made learning the material and applying it to other aspects easier. 

In addition, through research about the area and compilation of our own experiences, we’ve discovered new places to explore throughout the area for our next lazy weekend. Our bucket lists have expanded, and we’re eager to fall further in love with LA and its wonderful offerings.


WHAT’S NEXT FOR SCOUT:
We’re looking to expand the languages present in our site, by translating and adding aspects so that international students can also feel more like home and more successfully explore their new cities. In addition, we’d like to add to the cities and colleges we’ve got, through a community and ratings/reviews feature that utilizes Twilio API and Yelp Fusion so that we can unite college students to share their adventures and grow together.
